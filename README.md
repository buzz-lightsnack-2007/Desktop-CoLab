# Desktop@CoLab
**_A Linux virtual machine, all in Google's servers._**

[**▶︎ Run**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/buzz-lightsnack-2007/Desktop-CoLab/blob/main/DesktopCoLab.ipynb)

## Warning
Apparently, Google has changed CoLab's Terms of Service to now disallow using this service as a consumer virtual machine; violating it will ban your access to CoLab runtimes. As a result, there's no reason to keep editing this, which is why this repository will be archived. The good news is that forks are welcome, just as long as it does not use Google CoLab as its main service.  

## Information
Google CoLaboratory uses an Ubuntu Linux runtime. **Let's maximize it!**

With the help of [remocolab](https://urlzs.com/jBN9S) by [demotomohiro](https://urlzs.com/ds5GF), Desktop@CoLab supports SSH and VNC connections. _However, the latter is not recommended due to poor performances._
