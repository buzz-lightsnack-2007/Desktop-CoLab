# Desktop@CoLab
**_A Linux virtual machine, all in Google's servers._**

[**▶︎ Run**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/buzz-lightsnack-2007/Desktop-CoLab/blob/main/DesktopCoLab.ipynb)

Google CoLaboratory uses an Ubuntu Linux runtime. **Let's maximize it!**

With the help of [remocolab](https://urlzs.com/jBN9S) by [demotomohiro](https://urlzs.com/ds5GF), Desktop@CoLab supports SSH and VNC connections. _However, the latter is not recommended due to poor performances._
